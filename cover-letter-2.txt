Good morning, my name is Liam Barstad and I'm a recent graduate of Turing School of Software and Design's back end program. At my 7 month, 1600-2000 hour long bootcamp, I was taught primarily in Ruby and JavaScript, and cultivated a deep knowledge of both languages. I am truly thankful of my bootcamp for two reasons. Firstly, it taught me the art of not just writing code, but writing idiomatically correct code, extensible code, test driven code, and writing with developer empathy. Secondly, I was required to work with a team, and to pay attention to the theories behind group development, such as agile. Using the learning techniques I gained, I also took it upon myself to learn Python, dive into machine learning, and create mobile apps in React Native. I am really excited to learn from and teach my peers, and work with other driven and friendly individuals to make awesome things happen. I hope that I get the opportunity to learn more about your company, and become a valuable asset to your team!
