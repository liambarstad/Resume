My name is Liam Barstad and I am a recent graduate of Turing School of Software and Design's back end program. I am a versatile developer who thrives at any level of the stack. I can build out the front end in HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and React. I can execute complex SQL queries and leverage ORMs such as ActiveRecord and the Django ORM. I can even utilize neural networks, lstm, DQNs, and linear classification. I have been known to seek out challenges. I will perservere, think laterally, and use every tool available to me to solve any problem I might face. But above all, I am committed to creating scalable, reusable, and organized object oriented code. As a team mate, I am friendly, diligent, and collaborative. I am always available to help others and/or learn from my peers. I hope I get the opportunity to learn more about your company and become a valuable asset to your team!
