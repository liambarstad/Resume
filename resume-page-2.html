            A mobile alarm app built in React Native, and deployed using Expo. Built to allow users to associate a location, such as a workplace or morning destination, to each alarm, using the MapView API. A back end Ruby application is sent periodic data from the mobile app, that checks if the travel time to that destination is exceeded. If so, the alarm is set back so that the user always arrives on time. Uses an onboard SQL database and features a customizable morning Itinerary.
